we need the following things 


(these are in the headers are are negotiated in the upgrade. the server sends back what is agreed to from my reading of the RFC.)

	client_no_context_takeover	cnct	true if present otherwise takeover
	server_no_context_takeover  snct	true if present otherwise takeover
	client_max_window_bits      cmwb    defaults to the max of 15 i believe
	server_max_window_bits      smwb	defaults to max of 15 i believe

These the client or server configure before negotioation.
zlib_memory_level 				zm		check zlibconfig and compress-nio for range of values shld be 5-9 if i recall
zlib_compression_level          zc      check zlibconfig and conmpress nio for range of values shold be 5-9 if i recall.


the non header args are what the node server imp does in its init for ws
and what we do during the upgrade process when PMCE is init with its extendedSocketType and PMCE.DeflateConfig.
shuld be close enough to the same to get analogous behavior.
